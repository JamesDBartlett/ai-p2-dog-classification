# Project 2: Dog Breed Classification with Convolutional Nerual Networks

## Note to reviewer:

To view my project notebook with all of the output cells intact, please [click here](https://github.com/JamesDBartlett/ai-p2-dog-classification/blob/master/P2_Dog_Breed_Classification.ipynb).  
  
I cannot export the file as HTML or PDF -- I have tried about a dozen different ways, but this was the only way I could preserve the output cells including the pictures of dogs and people, which I used to validate my models.  
  
Thank you!
